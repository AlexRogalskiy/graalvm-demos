# Native jshell + Espresso
This project showcases the integration between [GraalVM's native image](https://www.graalvm.org/reference-manual/native-image/) and Java-on-Truffle (Espresso), namely by building a native image of `jshell` that executes the dynamically generated bytecodes on Espresso.  
This hybrid mode achieves instant startup, beating the vanilla `jshell` in both: time to first interaction and time to evaluate a simple expression.  
It also enables `jshell` to run on Java 8.  

## Dependencies

Requires GraalVM >= 21.0 (11) with Native Image and Java-on-Truffle (Espresso) installed.
You can download GraalVM 21.0 (11) [here](https://www.graalvm.org/downloads/).

To install Native Image and Java on Truffle (Espresso), in the GraalVM 21.0 directory, run:
`./bin/gu install native-image espresso`

## How to build
```bash
export GRAALVM_HOME="/path/to/graalvm21.0"
sh build-espresso-jshell.sh
```
Generates a native executable: `espresso-jshell`.

## Usage
`espresso-jshell [options...]` by default runs on 11, with instant startup.

## Running jshell for Java 8
```bash
export GRAALVM_HOME="/path/to/graalvm21.0"
export JDK8_HOME="/path/to/jdk8"
sh jshell8.sh [options...]
```

You can run the following snippets to convince yourself that it runs in Java 8 mode:
```java
System.getProperty("java.vm.version");

// `jshell -C-source -C8` forbids getModule() access from code, 
// but it is still accessible through reflection.
Object.class.getModule();

// In true Java 8 mode, getModule() is not accessible at all,
// not even through reflection.
Class.class.getDeclaredMethod("getModule");
```

Pass system properties to Espresso with `-R-Dkey=value`.  
Pass polyglot options to Espresso with `-Rjava.InlineFieldAccessors -Rengine.Compilation=false`.

## Details
`espresso-jshell` behaves similar to `jshell -execution local` and should not be directly compared with the default jshell execution engine e.g. class redefinition is not supported (`jshell -execution local` doesn't support it either).  
It doesn't support execution engines other than `-execution espresso`.  
It's not fully standalone, it needs the jars/jmods to compile and for Espresso to run.  

## JShell patch for 8
To run on 8, `jshell` needs the following bugfix: https://github.com/openjdk/jdk/pull/2097 . Pre-compiled patch for jdk.jshell in `jdk.jshell-patch`.
